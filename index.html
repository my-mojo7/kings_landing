        <p>The King's Landing is the most versatile club in Bermuda and praises itself for not just gaining revenue
          during
          hours of darkness but also during daylight. King's Landing is located in a two-story building and makes use
          of both
          floors. The first floor hosts a restaurant/sports bar and pool tables which is open day and night. </p>
        <p>During the night, the second floor strictly for dancing, however, during daytime operations the second floor
          is used as a space that is rented out to entrepreneurs or event organizers.</p>

          <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <p>King's Landing has worked hard to differentiate itself from other nightclubs. It is the only nightclub in
            Bermuda
            to have two floors. Using both floors allows for King's Landing to accommodate more people than any other
            nightclub. King's Landing makes a strong effort to ensure that the nightclub experience isnâ€™t repetitive.
            To
            achieve this they hold special events, some of which have a set theme, they encourage their DJ to be
            creative which has led to unique mixes of music.</p>
